Software Development Life Cycle

Question:	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A great way to understand what the user is wanting is to ask them to explain it, and to get details into why they ware wanting it. Are they wanting something because they’ve had a bad experience? Are they wanting something for functionality or Convenience? Understanding what the user is asking for back be answered with user stories to support your understanding and to support the development of the project. It provides justification for the team to work on a functionality or a feature of the project.

Question: How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like to approach a project by first understanding what it is they want. I like to understand all the bells and whistles they are asking for so I can understand what foundation I need to work with and what I might also need to incorporate in the future of the program. In performing this I will distill what the customer is asking for so I can break them down into steps and I can figure out any necessary dependencies.

Question: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member is having transparent communication, maintaining professionalism and being transparent/honest in my communication even if it may not be something that they want to hear.
